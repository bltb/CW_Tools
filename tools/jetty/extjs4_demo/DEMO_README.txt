This demo is from section "1.6 Take it for a test drive" from the 2nd edition of eBook "Ext JS in Action".


To run the demo:

1. cd to the directory containing this README file and run "download_extjs4" to download file "ext-4.2.0.zip".

2. Unzip ext-4.2.0.zip in its current directory. This will create directory "ext-4.2.0".

3. Launch jetty using "run_jetty" while in the "extjs4_demo" directory.
Note: We are using the run_jetty command in load_tools.sh and not run_jetty.bat.

4. Go to http://localhost:8080/list/extjs4_demo.html
Note: File "example_output.jpg" shows you what you should see. 
(If the web browser prompts you for a username and password, use BL and BLBL respectively).
