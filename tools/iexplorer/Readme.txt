=================================================
Last Updated: June 18, 2001

DESCRIPTION
============
CDLLOGVW is an application that provides error log viewing when encountering 
recent difficulties downloading data from the internet. When you encounter a 
code down load failure, run CDLLOGVW.EXE.  This tool displays code down load 
error logs and details of recently failed code down loads on your machine. 


BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
The CDLLOGVW is supported Windows 95 and later; or Windows NT (4.0 and later) 
Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. It requires 150K of free space on your hard drive.
 
USAGE
========
To view a log for a failed code download, select the log by name and then 
choose "View Log". Names are CLSIDs of the controls as you see them on the 
CLASSID attribute in the OBJECT tag. You can see the parameters of the OBJECT 
tag by choosing' View Source' from the browser menu. "View Log" navigates to 
the log file in a new browser window.

To delete a log file, choose "Delete Entry" in CDLLOGVW. Logs get scavenged 
by the browser cache subsystem automatically, so you don't have to worry about 
them cluttering up your hard disk space.
