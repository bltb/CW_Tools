# Maven

## Difference between the Maven Surefire and Maven Failsafe plugins:
From https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/:
"The Failsafe Plugin is designed to run integration tests while the Surefire Plugin is designed to run unit tests."

## JFrog - https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Maven+Repository
From https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/1898/what-is-an-artifactory:
"Artifactory is a product by JFrog that serves as a binary repository manager.  

The binary repository is a natural extension to the source code repository, in 
that it will store the outcome of your build process, often denoted as artifacts. 
Most of the times one would not use the binary repository directly but through a 
package manager that comes with the chosen technology.

Note that you do not need a very large team to start reaping benefits from binary 
package management. The initial investment is not very large and the benefits are 
felt immediately. 

My personal opinion is that binary repositories are as vital a part of a well 
designed devops setup as the source code repository or continuous integration."
