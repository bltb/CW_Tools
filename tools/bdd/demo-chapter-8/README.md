chapter-2 demo from "BDD In Action"

My comments from chapter-8-master/flying-high-tests/pom.xml:

	This is a nice demo encompassing the following:
	- JBehave, including ".story" files and "step" (Java) classes.
	- Selenium/WebDriver automated tests using Thucydides's own integration of WebDriver.
	      From https://github.com/thucydides-webtests/thucydides:
	      "Note: In November 2014 Thucydides was renamed "Serenity" and now has been migrated to a new 
	       Git repository: https://github.com/serenity-bdd"
	- Generates a Thucydides BDD acceptance test report (see target/site/thucydides/index.html)
	- Demonstrates use of the "page objects" pattern (see "pages" directory).
	- Using Thucydides "@Steps" annotation (Note: different to the "@Step" annotation).
	- Demonstrates a simple website using AngularJS.
