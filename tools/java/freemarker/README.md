## Apache FreeMarker
https://freemarker.apache.org/

Freemarker is a templating engine. 

I've seen this used to dynamically generate web pages in Tomcat (see the .ftl files in CW_Tools/tools/java/spock/demo25)

Apparently it can also be used on the command-line.
Mentioning the tool here in case I ever need something like this.
