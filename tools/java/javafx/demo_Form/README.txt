This is the demo "Creating a Form in JavaFX" from "Getting Started with JavaFX" (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/JFXST.pdf)

This demonstrates create a GUI programatically, i.e. NOT graphically using the JavaFX "Scene Builder" GUI.

As per the steps in the guide, this demo was created using the NetBeans IDE (https://netbeans.org/downloads/), but it can also be compiled by simply typing "ant" to invoke the NetBeans-generated build.xml file.

To run the demo you can simply double-click the executable jar file.
