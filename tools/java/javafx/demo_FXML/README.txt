This is the demo "Using FXML to Create a User Interface" from "Getting Started with JavaFX" (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/JFXST.pdf)

This demonstrates using FXML to define the program GUI. FXML is an XML format generated by the JavaFX "Scene Builder" GUI tool, but it can also be hand-written. It's also perfectly okay to edit the XML generated by "Scene Builder".

In the NetBeans IDE, double-click the projects ".fxml" file and it will launch the JavaFX "Scene Builder", where you can drag-and-drop graphical widgets. I not 100% sure about this, but when using NetBeans IDE you might still need to separately install the JavaFX "Scene Buidler" application (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html).

As per the steps in the guide, this demo was created using the NetBeans IDE (https://netbeans.org/downloads/), but it can also be compiled by simply typing "ant" to invoke the NetBeans-generated build.xml file. When creating the project in NetBeans IDE, choose the JavaFX sub-project type "JavaFX FXML Application". This will create an initial .fxml file for you.

To run the demo you can simply double-click the executable jar file.
