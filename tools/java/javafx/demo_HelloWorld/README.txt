This is the "Hello World, JavaFX Style" demo from "Getting Started with JavaFX" (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/JFXST.pdf)

As per the steps in the guide, this was created using the NetBeans IDE (https://netbeans.org/downloads/), but it can also be compiled by simply typing "ant" to invoke the NetBeans-generated build.xml file.

To run the demo you can simply double-click the executable jar file. However, you won't see the output written to the console when you click the button, so you're probably better off running from the command-line it using "java -jar JaxaFXHelloWorldDemo".
