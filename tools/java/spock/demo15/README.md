# Spock: Making larger Spock specs more readable.

The included test demonstrates the Spock and Groovy syntax for reducing the amount of testing code:

o Grouping assertions against the same object using the Spock "with()" construct.
o Grouping calls to the same object using the Groovy "with()" construct.


To run test:
`mvn test`
