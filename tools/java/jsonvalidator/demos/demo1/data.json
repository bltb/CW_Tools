{"testimonial":"Your Technical Support Engineer Jeremy who I spoke to this morning has been outstanding in investigating the issue and although no permanent resolution is forthcoming at the moment I believe that he had done everything possible to resolve the issue. I come away from what was a potentially stressful situation in a positive frame of mind. The initial response I had felt like a bit of a fob off (indicating that I needed to upgrade my system) without first enquiring about the details of the issue. However my call this morning with Jeremy has made this a positive customer experience.","jobtitle":"Customer survey comment"},

{"testimonial":"I was working on below JIRA. I found that these are very well written JIRAs. Appreciate your efforts. What I liked about these 3 JIRAs is - exact steps provided, supported data and case backup provided, there are sufficient samples of data, there are 3-4 examples too, there is list of troubleshooting tries, there is analysis done, all 3 are related but you nicely separated them logically. It is enjoyable to work on such JIRAs.","jobtitle":"Senior Principal Software Engineer"},
{"testimonial":"I was impressed at the amount of work put in by the technical support engineer. He had deep knowledge of the product and related components and he put in additional work and investigation offline so that he had a workaround available during a follow-up WebEx. The support exceeded my expectations in this instance as I didn't think a solution or workaround would be possible.","jobtitle":"Customer survey comment"}
