How to run JavaCC Demo
======================

NOTE: Both of the following two methods require you to first setup the Java environment.


Running the demo in a Cygwin shell:
1. Run "ant" to download Ant and setup the Ant environment.


Running the demo in a Windows cmd.exe:
1. Run "ant" in a Cygwin shell to download Ant and generate tools/ant/setenv.cmd to setup the Ant environment for Windows.
2. Run setenv.cmd
3. ant


TODO:
o Send the generated Java files to a local "src" directory by using the "javacc" Ant task.
o Compile the java files to a local "classes" directory and run the demo from there also.
