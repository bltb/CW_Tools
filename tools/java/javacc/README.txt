How to run JavaCC Demo
======================

This demo (adder.jj) is taken from the tutorial in tutorial/javacc-tutorial.pdf, which came from https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/JavaCC-Tutorial/javacc-tutorial.pdf


Both of the following two methods to run the demo require you to first setup the Java environme:t:

A. Running the demo in a Cygwin shell.
1. Run "ant" to download Ant and setup the Ant environment.

B. Running the demo in a Windows cmd.exe.
1. Run "ant" in a Cygwin shell to download Ant and generate tools/ant/setenv.cmd to setup the Ant environment for Windows.
2. Run setenv.cmd
3. ant


TODO:
o Perhaps try using the "javacc" Ant task. It looks like it might be a built-in Ant task (see https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javacc.html).
