This (ca3) was used to create a JKS with chain for clear1.cwlab.local.

Certicate serial numbers:

root:
Serial number: f9c3add080a26d78

intermediate:
Serial number: 999999

server:
Serial number: 1000



NOTE: The "serial" file for the root CA was initialized to "999999". The "serial" file for the intermediate CA was initialized to "1000". These number were chosen so that the server cert ended up with the lowest serial number numerically.
