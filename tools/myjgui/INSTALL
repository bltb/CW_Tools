	INSTALLING MyJgui

Be sure that you have the java runtime installed. If you don't , make sure you download it from java page before running the application.

Linux/Unix

   1. Unpack the archive: 
	tar -xzf myjgui[version].tar.gz. 
	This creates the directory ./myjgui[version]
   2. Change to myjgui directory and run ./myjgui.sh. 
	The myjgui.sh runs: java -jar myjgui.jar

or use MyJgui universal installer:

   1.  Download and run: java -jar MyGInstaller.jar 

So you have to have java in your PATH: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java.
That's it.

Windows

   1. Unpack the archive myjgui[version].zip
   2. Change to mygui directory and run myjgui.bat. 
	The myjgui.bat runs: java -jar myjgui.jar 

or use MyJgui universal installer:

   1. Download and run: java -jar MyGInstaller.jar. 

So again you have to have java binary in you PATH, but this should be already done for you when installing the java runtime. That's it.
