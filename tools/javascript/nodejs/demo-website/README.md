Demo website from "BDD In Action" - see page 208

To run the website, using nodejs, you can use my CW_Tools http-server wrapper,
and point to the files in the "app" sub-directory:

cd flying-high
http-server app

This website uses Angular JS. From https://angularjs.org/:

"HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it 
for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML 
vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily 
expressive, readable, and quick to develop."
