As per the “QuickStartGuide.wiki” file included in https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-
downloads/v2/code.google.com/crypto-js/CryptoJS%20v3.1.2.zip this decryption will work with an image encrypted as follows:

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in kafka160120.jpg -out kafka160120.jpg.encrypted -pass pass:"hello" -e -base64

Useful information was found here regarding handling of the multi-line base64 output generated by openssl.exe:

I downloaded CryptoJS from here:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/downloads

I used JQuery from here:
https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js

Original inspiration and idea came from here: 
https://alicebobandmallory.com/articles/2010/10/14/encrypt-images-in-javascript
This approach focus on using an HTML canvas object to 'paint' the image into.
