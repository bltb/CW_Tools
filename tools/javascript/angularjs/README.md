## AngularJS
https://angularjs.org/

From https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction :
"AngularJS is what HTML would have been. It lets you use HTML as your template language 
and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and 
succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code 
you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser."

From "BDD In Action":
"It’s increasingly rare these days to see an application without any clientside behavior. 
Modern applications need to provide rich, interactive experiences that can’t be
achieved with older approaches. This can only be done by including at least some
business logic and behavior within the UI layer. Modern JavaScript-based frameworks
such as Angular JS and Backbone take this to the point where the client layer can be
considered an application in its own right, calling remote web services for tasks that 
it can’t perform locally or to retrieve the data it needs to function."
