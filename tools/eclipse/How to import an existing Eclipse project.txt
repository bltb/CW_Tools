How to import an existing Eclipse project into Eclipse
======================================================
NOTE: See the example Eclipse project in in tools/java/props2objs 

Steps to import the project...


1. Import the project directory (e.g. "props2objs") into Eclipse:
"File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace".


2. Change the Java version used by Eclipse:
If you have imported the project into a different appliance, you may need to re-point the project to an existing Java installation.
2.1. First go here:
"Project > Properties > Libraries"
2.2. Then, if the "JRE System Library [jdk...]" says "(unbound)", you need to point to a new Java installation. Double-click the entry and either point to an existing  "c:\jdk-..." directory, or select the option "Workspace default JRE (jdk-...).


3. The Project's "Run > Run Configurations..." and "Run > Debug Configurations..." configurations:
You don't need to do anything here! The "Java Application > action1" and "Java Application > action2" run and debug launchers should already be present. These supply the input argument "action1" or "action2" respectively.

These launch configurations were imported automatically because they have been configured as shared files, as follows:
1. Right-click on the Project name and select "New > Folder". This is where our launch configurations will be saved by Eclipse.
2. Go to "Run > Run Configurations..." and select each of "FW (disable)" and "FW (enable)". 
3. Select the "Common" tab and select "Shared file". 
4. Click "Browse..." and navigate to the new folder we added earlier.
5. Click "Apply". You should now see two ".launch" files in the directory.

4. Run the "action1" or "action2" launcher from "Run > Run Configurations..." or "Run > Debug Configurations...". 
Output should be seen in the Eclipse console window.
