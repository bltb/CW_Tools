How to create a PDF with many embeddings
========================================

About Apache FOP:
From http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
"Apache™ FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting pages to a specified output. Output formats currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML (area tree representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent, RTF and TXT. The primary output target is PDF."

o Download Apache FOP from here:
http://apache.mirrors.nublue.co.uk/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/
This should give you a file such as "fop-2.1-bin.zip". It is around 24MB.

o Unzip the fop binary installation (100MB unzipped) and build the examples:
1. examples/fo
2. ant
NOTE: There should be an "embedding" example pdf built:
C:\tmp\fop-2.1\examples\fo>dir /s /b *embedding*
C:\tmp\fop-2.1\examples\fo\svg\embedding.fo
C:\tmp\fop-2.1\examples\fo\tests\embedding.pdf

o Add our own extra embeddings:
As you can see, the test input file (embedding.fo) is an XML file. If we want to embed our own (JPEG) images, we need to insert multiple lines like the following:
<fox:external-document content-type="jpeg" src="jpegs/test_jpeg${i}.jpeg"/>

I created a Bash script to generate my own version of "embedding.fo". I split the existing "embedding.fo" file into a beg.fo and end.fo and then wrote a Bash script to insert my extra content. Here's my script (generate_fo.sh):

cat beg.fo > embedding_new.fo

for i in {1..10000}
 do

	cat <<EOI >> embedding_new.fo

<fox:external-document content-type="jpeg" src="jpegs/Image${i}.jpg"/>

EOI

done

cat end.fo >> embedding_new.fo

Line 17 in the existing "embedding.fo" file is where my extra lines were inserted:
    11    master-name="first">
    12        <fo:region-body margin-top="1cm"/>
    13        <fo:region-before extent="1cm"/>
    14        <fo:region-after extent="1.5cm"/>
    15      </fo:simple-page-master>
    16    </fo:layout-master-set>
    17
    18    <fo:page-sequence master-reference="first">
    19      <fo:static-content flow-name="xsl-region-before">
    20        <fo:block line-height="14pt" font-size="10pt"

I then copied my new "emmbedding.fo" file in-place and ran "ant" again to rebuild the test files.
NOTE: I had to copy my directory of jpeg files ("jpegs") to the same directory where I ran "ant" from, i.e. "C:\tmp\fop-2.1\examples\fo".


Installing Ant (on Windows)
===========================
o Download (e.g. "apache-ant-1.10.0-bin.zip) from here:
https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
o Extract the zip directly under C:\
o Set environmental variable JAVA_HOME to your Java environment.
o Set environmental variable ANT_HOME to the directory you uncompressed Ant to.
o Add %ANT_HOME%/bin to your PATH.

The following can be used:
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45
set ANT_HOME=C:\apache-ant-1.10.0
set PATH=%ANT_HOME%/bin;%PATH%
